//The code below works because `.use` returns `this` which is `app`. So what we want to return in the `module.exports` is `app`, and we can chain on that declaration because each method invokation returns `app` after mutating based on the middleware functions

  .get('/*', (_, res) => res.sendFile(resolve(__dirname, '.', 'index.html')))  // Send index.html for any other requests.

  // notice the use of `_` as the first parameter above. This is a pattern for parameters that must exist, but you don't use or reference (or need) in the function body that follows.

      - This (module === require.main) will be true if run via node foo.js, but false if run by require('./foo')
      - If you want to test this, log `require.main` and `module` in this file and also in `api.js`.
        * Note how `require.main` logs the same thing in both files, because it is always referencing the "main" import, where we starting running in Node
        * In 'start.js', note how `module` is the same as `require.main` because that is the file we start with in our 'package.json' -- `node server/start.js`
        * In 'api.js', note how `module` (this specific file - i.e. module) is different from `require.main` because this is NOT the file we started in and `require.main` is the file we started in
